# Welcome to Astro 331

## 2023 Spring

Welcome to Astro 331: Space Systems Engineering. This practical hands-on course will explore spacecraft systems in more depth than you saw in Astro 310: Intro to Astro. If you are an Astro major, many topics from this course will be useful as you go on to work on FalconSAT in Capstone. 

This course uses Arduino-based labs to develop your engineering skills. Arduino is a ubiquitous open source electronic prototyping ecosystem built around a series of microcontrollers. 

In this class we will use Arduinos to build a satellite analog called FlatSAT to explore spacecraft design lessons. FlatSAT is a mini version of the FalconSAT Avionics Test Bed (ATB). 

## Lab overview

Each lab group of 2-3 students will build a FlatSAT using solderless breadboards. Arduino microcontrollers will run FlatSAT. You will communicate with FlatSAT using the Arduino IDE on the lab computers.  

Each lab will explore a new concept, and will add new components to FlatSAT.

1. electrical power

2. camera payload

3. communications

4. attitude system

5. integration and test

A prelab report will be due at the beginning of class for each lab day, as noted in the syllabus. 

In addition to these numbered labs, we will have a few introductory lab exercises. Some of these exercises will only take part of our class time. 

## Computer environment

We will use the Arduino integrated development environment (IDE) to communicate with FlatSAT. We will also use several otehr tools to organize code and other course materials. 

- git: software distribution and version control
  
  - tortoisegit: windows explorer integration for git

- typedown: markdown viewer/editor (for lab instructions)

- arduino-cli: manage arduino libraries

## Getting started

Before the first lab, open the `computer environment` folder and follow the instructions in `README.md`. 

Instructions and code for each lab are located in the lab's numbered folder.
