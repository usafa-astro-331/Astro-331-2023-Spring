# Getting started

You will need to install several programs. This folder contains programs and batch scripts you need to setup the correct computing environment. These tools are setup for Windows. Equivalent tools exist for Mac or Linux, but you'll have to install your own. 

Please run each of the following files by double clicking them. Note: you should view a batch script (\*.bat) before you run it to ensure that it does what you expect. You can do this with right click -> edit. 

`install_editors.bat`

- Arduino IDE

- marktext: a markdown editor/viewer

- notepad++: a useful text editor

`install_git.bat`

- git: version control software

- TortoiseGit: windows integration for git

`update_arduino.bat`

- updates arduino environment

- installs drivers for newer SAMD-based Arduino boards

Later in this course, additional batch scripts will use `arduino-cli.exe` to install drivers necessary drivers before each lab.
